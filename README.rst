Ghostils
========

This is a small set of tools that I've written for personal use and find to be incredibly helpful.
Despite the fact that all these tools are fairly unconnected (aside from the fact that I made them), each individual tool is small enough that I do not feel it makes sense to give each its own repository.

So, this repo is a bit of a grab-bag of helpful utilities I have written.

As always, all contributions, comments, suggestions and concerns are welcome.
